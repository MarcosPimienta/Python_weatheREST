# Python_weatheREST
This is a simple Python script that fetches and displays the current temperature for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3.x and the requests library. You also need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

# Installation
First, clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

Then, install the requests library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
# Usage
To run the script, first navigate to the directory containing the script:

cd Python_weatheREST/modules
Then run the script using Python:

python main.py
The script will prompt you to enter your OpenWeatherMap API key and the name of a city. Enter these, and the script will display the current temperature for that city.

# Error Handling
The script handles various errors gracefully, such as an invalid API key, an invalid city name, network errors, and issues with the OpenWeatherMap API. If any of these errors occur, the script will print a relevant error message and continue running.
